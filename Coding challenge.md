## Anagrams
- An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are an anagram of each other.
- Ex danger, garden ; salesman, nameless are anagrams
- Write a program in C# to find if given 2 strings are anagrams
```
public static bool  Anagram(string s1, string s2){

}
```

## Palindrome 
- A string of letters is a palindrome if it is identical to it's reversion. However we don't need to reverse the string to verify this is true.
- Ex madam, Anna, Civic, racecar
```
public static bool Palindrome(string s){

}
```

- PS: Not to use inbuild C# methods to reverse or sort etc...
