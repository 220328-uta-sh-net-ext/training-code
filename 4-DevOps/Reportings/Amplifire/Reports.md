# Cloud Computing (Briceson Roy)
## What is it?
Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.
It takes all the heavy lifting involved in crunching and processing data away from the device you carry around or sit and work at. It also moves all of that work to huge computer clusters far away in cyberspace. The Internet becomes the cloud, and voilà—your data, work, and applications are available from any device with which you can connect to the Internet, anywhere in the world.
Some of the most common services provided in cloud computing include:
- Email (i.e Salesforce, Gmail, Hotmail)
- Storage, BackUp and data retrieval (i.e iCloud, DropBox)
- Creating and Testing applications (i.e Azure, AWS)
- Analyzing Data
- Audio and Video streaming (i.e Spotify, Youtube)
- Delivering software on Demand
As of now the top 5 cloud providers:
1. AWS (Amazon Web Services)
2. Google Cloud Provider
3. Microsoft Azure
4. IBM Cloud
5. Oracle

# Types of Cloud Computing (Marcos Fonseca)
Cloud computing offers different services based on three delivery models.
Saas (software-as-a-service), Paas (platform-as-a-service), and Iaas (infrastructure-as-a-service).

## What is Saas?
Software-as-a-service is a service that offers on-demand pay per use of application software to users. Unlike licensed bought programs. This service is platform independent, and you don’t need to install the software on your PC. The cloud runs a single instance of the software and makes it available for multiple end-users. This makes cloud computing cheap. All the computing resources responsible for delivering SaaS are entirely managed by the provider. This service is accessible via a web browser or lightweight client applications.

## What is Paas?
Platform-as-a-service is mainly a development environment and is made up of a programming language execution environment, an operating systema, a web server, and a database, all of this encapsulate the environment where users can build, compile, and run their programs without worrying at the underlying infrastructure. In this model you manage data and the application resources. All other resources are managed by the provider.

<br>
## What is Iaas?
Infrastructure-as-a-service is a service that offers the computing architecture and infrastructure that is it offers all computing resources but in a virtual environment so that multiple users can access them, these resources include data storage, virtualization, servers, and networking. Most providers are responsible for managing the above for resources. If you will use this service, you will be responsible for handling other resources such as applications, data, runtime, and middleware.

# Cloud Computing (Gabriel Garcia)
the delivery of different services through the internet but are not limited to services. 
Cloud computing includes tools and applications such as data storage, servers, databases, \
networking, & software.
Cloud computing is coupled with a cloud based storage, a remote or virtual world(web)
database(stores data and applicable software to keep it running) 
# Cloud deployment models
- There are four cloud deployment models:
    
    1.  public
    2.  private
    3.  community
    4.  hybrid
    5.  multi-cloud
- with three main cloud service models:
    
    1.  Software as a Service (SaaS)
    2.  Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    3.  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Main point before making a cloud:
    
    1.  environment is based on ownership
    2.  scale
    3.  access
    4.  nature and purpos
1.  Public Cloud
    
    - less secure
    - no setup cost
    - no Infrastructure Management need
    - no maintenance
    - dynamic scalability
2.  Private Cloud
    
    - better control
    - higher cost
    - data security and privacy
    - customization
3.  Hybrid cloud
    
    - flexibility and control
    - cost
    - security
4.  Community cloud
    
    - Cost Effective shared
    - Security
    - Shared resources
    - Collaboration and data sharing

# Pros (Edith Kennedy)
---------- 
* Data control- centralizes data for large projects and branch offices
* Data backup and recovery
* cost efficient (pay as you go)
* increased productivity, 
* speed and efficient
* performance
* security 
* declutter
* Minimal management 
* Accessibility and pay per use 
* reliable 
* Huge cloud storage 
* Automatic software IDs
# Con
-----------
* Good internet connection is required for uploading and downloading
* Downtime-possible outages
* because the user doesn't own the infrastucture limited control 
and access to cloud infrastructure 
* A host of services are provided the consumption comes with restrictions 
and limited flexibility for apps and developments. Some of these cloud based data storages may be platform
dependent or have what is known as a "vendor lock-in" causing complications for migration
* Although saving and cost efficient the cost can become an (on-going) monthly expense compared 
to traditional methods the initial one time investment.
* Another drawback is security, and data vulnerability 
* technical issues could pose a problenm in which the vendor my not have a 24hr support team
* Lastly Vendor lock in
